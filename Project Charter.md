## Problem Statement
Nowadays group-message applications play an important role in everyone’s daily life. A problem arises where a group chat with too many people can get messy and unorganized. It takes time to read through all the messages but the fact is not all of them matter. The idea of our app is to allow users to have a more organized group chat by creating branches (or “topics”) inside the conversation, so that it’s easier for users to find what people talked about on the topics that they are interested in.

## Project Objectives
The application allows users to socialize
- Create account/login
- Add friends
- One-on-one chat
- Group chat
The application allows users to organize conversations
- Branches under a group chat
- Event (if time allows)

The application allows users to share moments (if time allows)
- Circle of friends (if time allows)
